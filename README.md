# GYBS
GYBS is a set of base stuff for any .NET Standard project. The idea behind is not to enforce anything - just grab the parts you're intrested in and help yourself.

## How to use it?
All parts are available via NuGet (e.g. https://www.nuget.org/packages/Gybs/ for base).

More details soon. Meanwhile, see https://github.com/wk0w/gybs-examples for some examples.
